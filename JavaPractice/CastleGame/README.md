# A Castle Game in Java

## Introduction

This is a simple game that I created to practice Java programming. The game is a text-based game where the player can move around a castle and interact with different objects. The game is still a work in progress, but I plan to add more features and improve the game as I continue to learn Java.

## How to Play

To play the game, simply run the `CastleGame.java` file. The game will prompt you to enter commands to move around the castle. Here is the map of the castle:

```
Bar -- Hallway -- Geust Room
         |
         Book Room -- main bedroom
```
