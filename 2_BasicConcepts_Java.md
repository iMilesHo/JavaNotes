# Basic Concepts of Java

## word explanation
- RAM: Random Access Memory, a type of computer memory that can be accessed randomly, meaning any byte of memory can be accessed without touching the preceding bytes.
- primitive data types: basic data types provided by Java, such as int, float, double, char, boolean, byte, short, and long.
- expression: a combination of variables, operators, and method calls that evaluates to a single value.
- statement: a complete unit of execution that can include one or more expressions.
- keyword: a reserved word that has a specific meaning and cannot be used for other purposes in the language.
- identifier: a name given to a variable, method, class, or package
- variable: a container that holds data that can be changed during the execution of a program.
- code block: a group of statements enclosed in curly braces `{}`.
- whitespace: any sequence of one or more spaces, tabs, or line breaks. Whitespace is used to separate tokens in a program and is generally ignored by the compiler.

## Keywords

Java have a set of keywords that are reserved words that cannot be used as identifiers. These keywords are used to define the syntax and structure of Java code. Here are some of the most commonly used keywords in Java:

int, float, double, char, boolean, byte, short, long, void, class, interface, extends, implements, package, import, new, this, super, static, final, abstract, public, protected, private, if, else, switch, case, default, while, do, for, break, continue, return, true, false, null

## method: reduce the code duplication and make the code reusable.
- parameters or arguments: a parameter is the definition in the method declaration. An argument is the actual value that is passed when the method is invoked.
- procedure: method that does not return a value.
- Metheod signature: the parameters (return value is not supported).
- Java do not support method overloading by return type.
- Java do not sopport default parameters value.

## How to compare code using IntelliJ IDEA
You can just click the code file using the right button of the mouse, and then click the `Compare with` option, and then click the `path` option to compare the code.

## check the history of the code
Also, you can use the right button of the mouse to click the code file, and then click the `Local History` option to check the history of the code.
